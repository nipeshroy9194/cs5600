Description : Implementation of the Malloc library

How to Run:
1. make
2. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_the_libmalloc.so
3. ./driver which is a driver program which allocates memory.

Highlights:
1. Implements buddy allocation.
2. Implements buddy using a Binary Tree.
3. Can be easily extended to multiple threads if the metadata being
allocated is dynamically allocated.

TODO's:
1. Application is single threaded & does not create threads and its arenas.
2. Allocates memory of the metadata being stored statically
3. Allocated maximum of 1MB of memory.
4. Due to the above limitations cannot use printf() and other library
calls which call malloc internally for buffer allocation as the
allocation fail and the driver might crash.
5. Does not implement malloc statistics.
6. Implement malloc hooks.
