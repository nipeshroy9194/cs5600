and calculating the time taken to allocate memory and
writing all the memory allocated using memset

The approximate size of the RAM is the last written line
on in the file "output".

After this the OOM killer should kill the process.

OUTPUT:
tailf -n 1 output to get approximate RAM of the machine.
